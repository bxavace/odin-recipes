    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Truly authentic Italian carbonara with bacon coal miners' recipe. One of my favorite comfort food.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>12 slices thick-cut, applewood-smoked bacon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry vermouth</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whipping cream (Optional)</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet and discard the rest. Chop bacon when cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and onion to reserved bacon fat in the skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour vermouth into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, about 1 minute. Mix in chopped bacon.</li>
        <li>Drain spaghetti, transfer to a large serving bowl, and mix in remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add bacon-onion mixture, Parmesan cheese, cream, eggs, and pepper to the hot pasta; stir until spaghetti is well coated and sauce is creamy.</li>
    </ol>
